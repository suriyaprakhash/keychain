# jSecretKeyChain

here we are using key pair - private to encrypt attribute map
and public to decrypt 

since RSA 2048 can only support encrypting/decrypting data of size 2048/8 = 256,
larger data cannot be encrypted using a key pair would need to use secret AES which defeats the purpose.

SO THIS BRANCH IS FOR REFRENCE AND IS USELESS
